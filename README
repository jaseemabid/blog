Hi. This is a [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)-powered blog hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Feel free to browse the source, fork, [ask me questions](http://twitter.com/jaseemabid), and post your own compelling blog posts. Because sharing is caring. We're developers, after all.

Inspired by [Zack Holman's blog](holman.github.com)

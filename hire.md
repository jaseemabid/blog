title: Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm looking for new opportunities
---

Thanks for reaching out to me with a new opportunity.

I'm interested in compilers, distributed systems and programming languages. I
care a lot about correctness and performance of software.

Some of the things I would really appreciate about a new job are,

1. Culture and being kind to each other matters a lot, and it is the one lesson
   I learned at Monzo. Almost nothing about a job is worth it in a toxic
   environment.

1. Working at [Monzo](https://monzo.com) has been an [incredibly rewarding
   journey][monzo blog] ðŸš€ so far but an entirely different set of engineering
   problems excite me. I'd not trade a job at Monzo for another startup solving
   similar problems using similar technology.

1. I prefer working with well typed (or) functional languages whenever possible
   and I'm reasonably good at Haskell, Erlang & Rust. I'd be really interested
   in a role that allows me to work with one of these stacks full time.

1. I prefer to work in slightly mature and larger companies than very early
   stage startups. Anecdotally I've been able to focus on fewer but more complex
   engineering problems for a longer duration in such environments.

1. I'm not interested in Go. I wrote a lot of Go at Monzo and *I really don't
   like it*.

1. I tend to prefer old school rock solid tech over the new shiny things. I'm
   far more excited about scaling robust old school Django + PostgreSQL apps
   than managing 1000+ micro services.

1. This doesn't mean I'm not constantly learning new things. I do.

1. I am [usually interested in technology and systems a lot more than
   products][why]. I might be the wrong fit for a young startup that is
   primarily concerned about shipping a product and validating market fit.

1. But if that startup is trying to formally verify software or write the most
   high performing TCP stack, I'd be very interested in talking to them.

1. I don't believe in most crypto-currencies or blockchains in its current form.

1. I prefer to work in an office, I've not been very productive working remotely
   in the past.

1. I cannot relocate from London right now and would need the company to sponsor
   a work visa.

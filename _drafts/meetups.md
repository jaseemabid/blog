title: On tech meetups
---

I run a couple of programming/tech meetups in Bangalore with varying levels of
success. Some of them like the Emacs meeetup can be considered
dead, [haskell meetup][haskell] is brimming with so much enthusiasm and activity
these days and [papers we love][pwl] is having a rough time; which
I [wrote about][pwl_post] recently.

A friend of mine got in touch me a today morning asking some advice about
starting a new meetup and I felt that a blog will be more appropriate.

I'm going to predominantly talk about 2 things. The mistakes and lessons I
learned as well as why I do what I do.

This quote summarizes running a meetup in the best way possible.

also starting a meetup is never a problem. Keeping it going month onmonth is far
more challenging. Ask <a href="https://twitter.com/_swanand">@_swanand</a> or <a

**Consistency** is the key element that sets good meetups apart and this is
something I learned the hard way. Setting the bar too high reduced the frequency
of the PWL meetings [^1] and then no one gained anything out of it. Even if you
don't have the best material for the day, it is beneficial for the community to
meet and discuss what they have learned recently or found interesting. It also
creates a habit and regular attendees will remember to not schedule anything
else every 3rd Saturday from 3 to 6pm.

Every meetup needs a Benevolent Dictator For Life, aka **BDFL**. Someone needs
to take ownership of the whole show and ensure things go well. This includes
scheduling events on time, finding different venues (more on this later),
talking to potential speakers - filtering bad ones as well as helping them.
Little things like making sure everyone gets a tea goes a long way. Put out your
contact number somewhere visible so that folks can call you when they cant find
the building or needs some quick information. Listen to their issues and
criticisms.

Make sure the content is **accessible** to everyone. Really good programmers
don't need you - they can learn most of it themselves. Targeting absolute
beginners and doing 101 talks repeatedly can get very boring and the organizers
will lose interest as well. The sweet spot is intermediary and above, where
everyone can learn something - and this is why PWL is so close to my heart. I
put the effort of organizing the event and come back satisfied after each one
learning so much I wouldn't have learned otherwise.

Last but not the least, stay away from **politics**. Try not to host it at the
same venue all the time. Try not to always have the same speaker. This might be
necessary in some contexts; for eg when you have no one else to volunteering to
talk. Try to maintain a balance.

There are issues which I haven't been able to sort out as well. One of the main
concerns is the gender balance. The last Haskell meetup had one or two girls to
start with and there was no one present for the second half. It's the same case
almost all the time and I have no idea how to improve this.

Moving on to part 2, why I do what I do.

This is going to be short. PWL introduced me to a lot of people I wouldn't have
met otherwise. It taught me things I wouldn't have learned otherwise. I don't
need more reasons to do this, but I could iterate a few perks that I enjoyed
unexpectedly. This is only what I can remember now and not a definitive list.

1. PWL got me stated with reading papers semi regularly and I have learned about
   computer science than any other resource. You have to read better to really
   improve yourself and the information density in papers is often the highest.
   Most importantly it made me read wide, introducing me to a ton of cool ideas
   like distributed consensus and lock free data structures.

2. I met a lot of people I can proudly call friends now. Ramki, someone I
   respect a lot and ask for advice all the time. Vaidhy and Anita after their
   awesome RAFT talk. I met Balaji Rao at the Haskell meetup and my company
   immediately hired him. He was a great chap to work with before we both moved
   on with other jobs. PS: I made close to â‚¹100,000 in referral bonus as well ðŸ˜Ž

3. It gave me a job when I really needed one. I met Naren because he talked
   about Quickcheck at a Haskell meetup. I ended up working with him at Fybr. We
   build some interesting distributed systems in Erlang and had lots of fun.

4. Soft skills. I must have improved my people skills by being are forced to
   take into account the concerns of a very wide community. This can often be a
   very interesting challenge. I have given a couple of talks by now and
   hopefully improved my speaking skills as well.

5. I met a couple of insanely good engineers - who can really inspire and
   motivate you to move forward. Talking to Anita once in a while makes me
   realize how much I have left to learn. Its a humbling experience.

Let me know your thoughts on twitter.

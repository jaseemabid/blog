title: The Σ problem
---

It's been 6 weeks at [RC][1]. Half of my program is over and it's time for some
reflection and introspection.

Most days I'm happy with the progress I make, but somehow the 6 weeks doesn't
add up. I learned a lot out of [Olifant][2] and I probably won't be able to fit
all of it into 20000 words. I must have rewritten some parts of it over half a
dozen times. Each rewrite is a proof that I learned something new which I didn't
know maybe 48hrs ago.

But somehow things doesn't add up. I often wonder if it really should have taken 6 weeks.

Something feels wrong about

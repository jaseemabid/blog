# Hi! I'm Jaseem Abid ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer programmer interested in compilers, distributed systems, and
programming languages.

I'm an extrovert who loves meeting people. Talk to me about religion, politics,
economics, oncology, history, beer, philosophy or anything technology.

I spent 12 weeks at [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) from May 22 to Aug 10
2017 trying to be a better programmer. It was amazing and [I wrote about what I
did there][rc blog].

I work at Apple as a Site Reliability Engineer in London. Previously I worked at
[Monzo](https://monzo.com) making banking awesome! ðŸš€ Its been an [incredibly
rewarding journey][monzo blog] so far.

You can reach me over [email](mailto:jaseemabid@gmail.com) or

# Hi! I'm Jaseem Abid

I'm a computer programmer at Bangalore, India interested in distributed systems,
programming languages and Haskell.

I'm an extrovert who loves great conversations. An atheist, pluviophile and
sapiosexual interested in a lot of things like religion, politics, economics,
oncology, history, beer, and philosophy.

Sometimes [I buy random people coffee and listen to them](http://haveyoumetjaseem.in).

You can reach me over [email](mailto:jaseemabid@gmail.com).

Find my [resume](/Jaseem Abid.pdf) here.

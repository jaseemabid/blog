# Hi! I'm Jaseem Abid ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer programmer interested in compilers, distributed systems,
programming languages and Haskell.

I'm an extrovert who loves meeting people. Talk to me about religion, politics,
economics, oncology, history, beer, philosophy or anything technology.

I spent 12 weeks at [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) from May 22 to Aug 10
2017 trying to be a better programmer. It was amazing.

I work at [Monzo](https://monzo.com) in London making banking awesome! ðŸš€

You can reach me over [email](mailto:jaseemabid@gmail.com) or

now.

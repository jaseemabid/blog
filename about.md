# Hi! I'm Jaseem Abid ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer interested in compilers, distributed systems and
programming languages.

I play tennis and enjoy long hikes. I enjoy a good history book/podcast. Usually
you will find me watching F1 on a Sunday afternoon. I live in London, UK since
2018.

I spent 12 weeks at [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) from May 22 to Aug 10
2017 trying to be a better programmer and [it was amazing and rewarding
experience][rc blog]. I spent another 6 weeks from May 20 to June 28 2024
learning about deep learning and transformers.

I work as a Site Reliability Engineer at MongoDB. Previously I worked Apple,
Twitter and [Monzo](https://monzo.com) in various engineering roles. ðŸš€
Its been an [incredibly rewarding journey][monzo blog] so far.

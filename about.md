# Hi! I'm Jaseem Abid

I'm a computer programmer at interested in distributed systems, programming
languages and Haskell.

I'm an extrovert who loves great conversations. An atheist, pluviophile and
interested in a lot of things like religion, politics, economics, oncology,
history, beer, and philosophy.

I spend 12 weeks at [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) from May 22 to Aug 10
2017 trying to be a better programmer.

You can reach me over [email](mailto:jaseemabid@gmail.com).

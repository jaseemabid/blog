## How to build toy compilers for fun and profit

---
![](./github.png)

???

- This paper is all about implementation details.

---
![](./pitch.png)

???

- Elevator pitch
- This works

---
![](./abstract.png)

???

- Educational approach, taking the wizards out of the compilers

A bit more details into how this works in 3 steps before jumping into steps.

- Why is this approach exciting?

- Scheme saves you the trouble of writing a parser
- And parsers are the least fun

---

???

- Assembly isn't that hard and this is a good way to learn about it

- There really isn't enough time to cover 24, I'd be happy with 5
- The first step is always the hardest ;)

---

???

- Spend as much time as required here in this step to make things clear

- Is this a compiler yet?

# Recap; why did we do all that?

- Its far easier to generate ASM rather than a binary
- Avoid object files & ELF for now
- A tiny runtime in C is really handy
- Conveniently hiding some OS details
- Link to libc for stdlib
- argc and argv
- IO
- linkers
- ...

# 2. Immediate Constants

- Types that fit into a machine word
- `int`,  `bool`,  `char`,  `()`
- Types must be available at runtime for `integer?`, `printf` etc
- Tags with bit masking

Note the differences from the paper

---
![](./immediate.c.png)

---
![](./unary.png)

???

- Primitives that accept one word
- No need for a function call
- Inline asm
- inc, dec, int->char, zero?, null?
- Talk about insights

---

Binary primitives, no surprises here

Local variables in stack

Least fun parts, gotta know some asm jumping

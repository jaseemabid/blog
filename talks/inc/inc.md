# The constant factors

- Conveniently hiding some OS details
- Link to glibc
- Process life time
- Avoid object files & ELF for now
- argc and argv
- IO
- linkers

# 2. Immediate Constants

- Machine words
- Types must be available at runtime
- integer?, printf
- mask and tag

# 3. Unary primitives

  - Primitives that accept one word
  - No need for a function call
  - Inline asm
  - inc, dec, int->char, zero?, null?

- Elevator pitch
- This works

- Educational approach, taking the wizards out of the compilers

A bit more details into how this works in 3 steps before jumping into steps.

- There really isn't enough time to cover 24, I'd be happy with 5
- The first step is always the hardest ;)

---

- Spend as much time as required here in this step to make things clear

The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit
8080 microprocessor

# Recap; why did we do all that?

- Its far easier to generate ASM rather than a binary
- Avoid object files & ELF for now
- A tiny runtime in C is really handy
- Conveniently hiding some OS details
- Link to libc for stdlib
- argc and argv
- IO
- linkers
- ...

# 2. Immediate Constants

- Types that fit into a machine word
- `int`,  `bool`,  `char`,  `()`
- Types must be available at runtime for `integer?`, `printf` etc
- Tags with bit masking

Note the differences from the paper

---
![](./immediate.c.png)

---
![](./unary.png)

???

- Primitives that accept one word
- No need for a function call
- Inline asm
- inc, dec, int->char, zero?, null?
- Talk about insights

Binary primitives, no surprises here

# But Rust?

---
class: middle

### 1. Expressive types for representing and working with AST

--
### 2. Error handling that is actually fun!

--
### 3. Rich stdlib, all I needed was nom, quickcheck and colored

--
### 4. Small traits are great!

--
### 5. Modules are brilliant!

---
class: middle

### 6. Explicit mutability

--
### 7. Explicit unsafe

--
### 8. FFI that isn't black magic!

--
### 9. Tooling! Rust docs, test framework and editor support

--
### 10. Community ‚ô•

# The wishlist

--
### 1. Sometimes ownership can be tricky and you don't care

--
### 2. Knowing the size at compile time can be tricky.

--
### 3. Refinement types for AST

--
### 4. Better types for representing things like x86 ASM

--
### 5. Persistent structs

---

## Final thoughts.
### Why would you do this to yourself Jaseem?

--
1. Immensely challenging & intellectually rewarding

--
1. Understanding the true cost of high level constructs

--
1. Understanding what compilers can and cannot do!

--
1. Understanding memory management & language runtimes

--
1. Rust is pure fun!

--
1. Systems programming is fun!

--
1. Chase rabbit holes! üê∞üï≥

--
1. Makes me ‚ù§ programming again

# Containers and why should you care?

## Jaseem Abid

---
class: solarized

# Let's start with VMs

--
## Isolated environments

--
## Root access, custom users and access controls

--
## Experimentation

--
## Project specific libraries and tools

--
## Run with VirtualBox, VMWare or KVM

---
class: solarized

# How many of them can you run at a time?

--
## How is the memory shared?

--
## How is the CPU shared?

--
## How long does it take to boot?

--
## How much space does it take on disk?

---
class: solarized

# What if I told you, we can do better?

--
## Think of containers as VMs on steroids

--
## But not really

--
## We will refine our definition over time

---
class: solarized

# Alright! Why should I care?

--
## We are going to look at a few common use cases

--
## Take a note of some cool things in the meanwhile

--
## Understand how the fundamentals work

--
## Deeper look as time permits

--
## cgroups, namespaces and COW

--
## Other cool kids in the ecosystem

--
## Future

# Quick demos

---
class: middle, solarized

# 1. Try a different OS!

    $ docker run -it ubuntu

---
class: solarized

# What's going on there?

## Container Images
## The docker daemon automatically manages them
## We could get a bash shell immediately
## Yay!

---
class: center, middle, solarized

##  ðŸ’¡ Just a process!

---
class: middle, solarized

# A few more commands

    $ docker run ubuntu cat /etc/issue
    $ docker run centos cat /etc/issue
    $ docker run ubuntu hostname

---
class: middle, solarized

# 2. Get started super quickly

    $ docker run -it haskell

---
class: middle, solarized

# 3. Isolated environments

    $ docker run ubuntu ps -e

---
class: middle, solarized

# What's going on here?

## A container only sees things in itself

--
## Process visible from the host

--
## Great way to debug, plays well with unix tools

---
class: center, middle, solarized

# ðŸ’¡ Linux name spaces

---
class: solarized

# 4. Ephemeral environments

## Hey I don't like ps, I want htop!

--

    $ docker run -it ubuntu
    $ apt-get update && apt-get install htop
    $ htop

--
## Ephemeral environments, will go away once you exit the process

---
class: center, middle, solarized

![](images/htop.png)

---
class: center, middle, solarized

# I bet that is a lot of space on disk!

---
class: center, middle, solarized

# ðŸ’¡ Copy on write file system

---
class: middle, solarized

# 5. Reproducible environments

    $ cat htop/Dockerfile

    FROM ubuntu
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y htop
    CMD htop

    $ docker build -t htop .
    $ docker run -it htop

class: middle, solarized, smaller

```
FROM ubuntu:latest
WORKDIR /inc

# Setup base image deps
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    libncurses5-dev \
    libx11-dev \
    wget \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install chez from source
RUN cd /tmp \
    && wget -q https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme/releases/download/v9.5/csv9.5.tar.gz \
    && tar -xf csv9.5.tar.gz \
    && cd csv9.5 \
    && ./configure \
    && make install \
    && cd - \
    && rm -rf csv9.5.tar.gz csv9.5

ADD . /inc

# Image history

---
class: middle, solarized

# 6. Super fast builds with caches

---
class: middle, solarized

# 7. Minimal environments

## Alpine Linux

---
class: middle, solarized, center

##  ðŸ’¡ argv[0]

---
class: middle, solarized

# 8. Resource capping

    $ docker run -it --memory 10m ubuntu
    $ docker run -it --cpus=".5" ubuntu

---
class: center, middle, solarized

# ðŸ’¡ Cgroups

---
class: middle, solarized

# What are these built of ?

--
## Copy on write file system

--
## Name spaces

--
## Cgroups

---
class: middle, solarized

# Namespaces

## Controls what a process can see

## PID, Mount, Network, Users etc

---
class: middle, solarized

# Cgroups

## Controls what a process can use

## Memory, CPU, Block IO, CPU, CPU Set, Devices

---
class: middle, solarized

# Copy on write

---
class: middle, solarized

# A few more things that we left out

--
## Docker hub and image registries

--
## Networking and ports

--
## Docker compose

--
## Volumes and mounts

--
## SELinux and AppArmor

---
class: middle, solarized

# Moar!

# Kubernetes

## Cloud orchestration

### Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

---
class: middle, solarized

# Why am I excited?

## Reproducible artifacts
## Environments that can be shared quickly
## Off the shelf tools on a declarative interface

# Consistency

### A consistent view of data on all nodes of the distributed system

class: center, middle

# Availability

### Queries are handled as long as at least one server is available

---
class: center, middle

# Partition tolerance

### System continues to work even when nodes cannot talk to each other

## HTTP Web caching provides client-server partition resilience by replicating documents, but a client-server partition prevents verification of the freshness of an expired replica. In general, any distributed database problem can be solved with either expiration based caching to get AP, or replicas and majority voting to get CP (the minority is unavailable). ]

In the decade since its introduction, designers and researchers have used (and
sometimes abused) the CAP theorem as a reason to explore a wide variety of novel
distributed systems. The NoSQL movement also has applied it as an argument
against traditional databases.

The “2 of 3” formulation was always misleading because it tended to oversimplify
the tensions among properties.

</quote>

---

<quote>

CAP prohibits only a tiny part of the design space: perfect availability and consistency in the presence of partitions, which are rare.

</quote>

---
class: middle

<quote>

Although designers still need to choose between consistency and availability
when partitions are present, there is an incredible range of flexibility for
handling partitions and recovering from them.

</quote>

<quote>

The modern CAP goal should be to maximize combinations of consistency and
availability that make sense for the specific application.

</quote>

---
class: middle

<quote>

Such an approach incorporates plans for operation during a partition and for
recovery afterward, thus helping designers think about CAP beyond its
historically perceived limitations.

class: middle

## Detect the start of a partition,
## Enter an explicit partition mode that may limit some operations
## Initiate partition recovery when communication is restored

---
class: middle

# Once the system enters partition mode, two strategies are possible

### Limit some operations, thereby reducing availability

### Record extra information about the operations that will be helpful during partition recovery

---
class: middle

# Which operations should proceed?

### Given a set of invariants, the designer must decide whether or not to maintain a particular invariant during partition mode or risk violating it with the intent of restoring it during recovery

---
## Unique keys in a database?

--
## Charging a credit card?

--
## Social Calendar

---
# Partition Recovery

--
### The state on both sides must become consistent

--
### Compensation for the mistakes made during partition

--
### Conflict resolution

--
### Think Git

### Google docs, hackerrank

# Hello world !

It was my new year resolution to write a tech blog in 2012, which I am starting now. I really doubt for how long I might do this, but I have good hope. 

For me, life is all about learning new things. That's what keeps me ticking all day long. I had a blog at blogspot, which apparently died because of low maintenance. I apparently don't like writing a lot. Then why blogging ? I plan to put more code here and less philosophy. Thats what happened to the old one. There was nothing good in writing at wordpress or blogspot. They are amazing tools for sure, but they were just not right for me!

Then I found [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). "A blogging framework for hackers", as they put it. Write blogs as markdown in the terminal with my vim, commit with git, push to github master and, Aha! the blog published. This felt more like my way of things.

Its an attempt to learn a lot of things together and to share it to the world real time. vim, yaml, ruby, gems, blogging and a lot like that.

I might write about JavaScript, git, Perl, programming in general, web development, jQuery, css, node, backbone, coffee script, gitweb, gsoc and anything like that under the sun. Watch this place for updates.

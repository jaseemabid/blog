title: Big Endian's Guide to SQLite Storage
---


I wanted to learn how databases like SQLite store data under the hood, so I
decided to [write some code][rsqlite] to inspect the database file. SQLite
famously stores the entire database in a [single file][sqlite-about], and the
[file format][file-format] is very well documented. Here is one diagram[^svg] to
get started instead of the roughly 13,848 words in that document.

![SQLite file format schema diagram](/images/sqlite/schema.svg)

While not impossible, it is somewhat tedious to read through the file format
documentation and figure out what exactly you need to get started. The above
diagram is that minimal starting point.

## 🌱 Quick Demo

It's easier to demonstrate this with a quick example. We create a tiny test
database and dump all its internal state with hexdump and a small program I
wrote called [rsqlite].

```sql
$ sqlite3 planets.db < planets.sql
$ cat planets.sql

CREATE TABLE planets (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  diameter INTEGER NOT NULL,
  distance INTEGER NOT NULL,
  moons INTEGER NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO planets (id, name, type, diameter, distance, moons) VALUES
  (1, 'Mercury', 'Terrestrial', 4879, 57910000, 0),
  (2, 'Venus', 'Terrestrial', 12104, 108200000, 0),
  (3, 'Earth', 'Terrestrial', 12742, 149600000, 1),
  (4, 'Mars', 'Terrestrial', 6779, 227900000, 2),
  (5, 'Jupiter', 'Gas Giant', 139820, 778500000, 79),
  (6, 'Saturn', 'Gas Giant', 116460, 1433000000, 83),
  (7, 'Uranus', 'Ice Giant', 50724, 2871000000, 27),
  (8, 'Neptune', 'Ice Giant', 49244, 4495000000, 14);
```

This creates a tiny, mostly empty 8KB file we can play with. Hexdump is smart
enough to avoid duplicate null rows with a single `*` and make the output
readable, so we can share the whole contents inline right here. No hidden magic,
this is it!

**Side note**: If you aren't familiar with hexdump output, the first column is
the offset from the beginning of the file. The 16 columns in the middle are
raw values in hexadecimal and the last section is the ascii representation of
the input data. Anything outside printable range becomes a dot.

```
$ hexdump -C planets.db

Some of the internal structure is already visible, but rsqlite makes it a lot
more clear and explicit.

👀 The similarity between the input data, raw hexdump and rsqlite is pretty
clear if you squint[^ui] hard enough.

To really understand how the data is stored, we need to take one more step. The
cell pointers at the start of the page point to a set of [Leaf Cells][btree]
containing a [Record][record-format] each at the end of the page. Every record
stores the size, types and values of a single database row in a compact block.

![SQLite Cells](/images/sqlite/cells.svg)

That's pretty much all the information you need to get started.

## 🦋 Motivating Example 1: Database Updates

It's really useful to have an exploratory tool of your own to deeply understand
the internals. For example, let's see how updates are handled.

```sh
$ sqlite3 planets.db "UPDATE planets SET name='🌍' WHERE id=3;"
```

We can make an educated guess from the rather self explanatory diff[^diff] of the
states.

It's a different story when the data cannot be updated in place. The new string
here is longer than the preallocated space, so sqlite does something more
interesting.

```sh
$ sqlite3 planets.db "UPDATE planets SET name='The pale blue dot' WHERE id=3;"

The whole row is written to a new location (at offset `3973`) and the pointers
are updated. Now why is the new pointer offset smaller than the previous one?

Docs got you covered.

> Cell content is stored in the cell content region of the b-tree page. SQLite
strives to place cells as far toward the end of the b-tree page as it can, in
order to leave space for future growth of the cell pointer array.

By inserting cell pointers at the start of the page from left to right and data
at the end of the page right to left, SQLite is aiming to not waste any disk
space pre allocating any blocks or sections and keep the database as small as
possible. The first cell pointer entry `4063` with the largest offset is the
earliest record, written to the end of the page. The rest of the cell pointers
are monotonically decreasing `[4032, 4001, ...]` as expected until an update
breaks the order and the cells have to be rearranged.

The `first_freeblock` is presumably tracked for the next insertion small enough
to fit there.

💡 This is the category of things I would have never learned if I didn't write
this from scratch or paid enough attention.


## 💨 🧹 Example 2: Vacuum

What really is [vacuum]?

> The VACUUM command rebuilds the database file, repacking it into a minimal
amount of disk space.

Let's just run it and see what happens.

```
$ sqlite3 planets.db "VACUUM;"
```

And we have this diff again.

We can make the following observations.

1. File change counter went up by 1 as expected. Schema cookie also changed, but I have no idea why.
2. The `free_block` is gone, SQLite successfully reclaimed the space in the middle 🧼.
2. The rows are ordered once again! I can imagine how running vacuum occasionally can reduce fragmentation and improve
    query performance, especially if you don't have any indexes.
4. The `cell_content_start` used to be 3836 in the first version, moved left to
    3793 after second update due to fragmentation and now back right to 3824. All
    tidy.
5. Compared to the first version, the cell pointers of rows 3-8 changed, only
    1,2 remained where it used to be. This is hinting that on large tables with a
    lot of changes, vacuum could be potentially very expensive.

## 🧑🏼‍🎓 Miscellaneous lessons learned

Other miscellaneous things I learned this week while working on this.

### 1. 🦀 Rust is very good at this kind of programs

The code to parse the core data structures at [schema.rs] is only about ~130 LOC
excluding docs, tests and the pretty printer. It took me a moment to
understand[^macro] the amazing [binrw] library I used to read/write the binary
data, but it was remarkably simpler than I expected. Would definitely recommend.

### 2. ⚖️ SQLite loves variable length encoded numbers

A substantial fraction of [schema.rs] is dedicated to SQLite's variable length
encoded numbers called varints.

From the docs,

> A variable-length integer or "varint" is a static Huffman encoding of 64-bit
twos-complement integers that uses less space for small positive values. A
varint is between 1 and 9 bytes in length. The varint consists of either zero or
more bytes which have the high-order bit set followed by a single byte with the
high-order bit clear, or nine bytes, whichever is shorter. The lower seven bits
of each of the first eight bytes and all 8 bits of the ninth byte are used to
reconstruct the 64-bit twos-complement integer. Varints are big-endian: bits
taken from the earlier byte of the varint are more significant than bits taken
from the later bytes.

SQLite source includes a standalone [tool/varint.c] which can be compiled into
a small executable to convert numbers varint ↔ decimals. Alternatively see
[varint.rs] for a naive readable implementation in Rust.

```
$ cc tool/varint.c -o varint
$ ./varint 1992
1992 = 8f 48
```

Numbers 1-128 would be represented in a single byte, but 128 for example would
need 2 bytes [0x81, 0x00] and 1992 would be [0x8f, 0x48].

I would naively assume that varints are substantially slower than fixed size
numbers but SQLite must have good reasons to make this tradeoff. Maybe real
world datasets contain a disproportionate amount of small numbers and the size
reduction must be worth the additional complexity. There might even be a perf
gain due to reduced disk IO.  Please let me know if you have more background
context on this.

### 🎪 3. The native data types are a very small set

Every datatype understood by SQLite at a storage later is documented at [§
Record Format][record-format] and it's a pretty small set. Notably there is a
dedicated type for numbers 0 and 1 and none for booleans or native timestamps.
SQLite [is not well typed by design][types] and that is easily my least favorite
part of the whole project.

## 🚀 Questions I want to ask later

I found it really useful to have this project as a starting point to ask more
deeper questions I've always had about databases. Recently for an unrelated work
I was looking deeper into DuckDB and how row storage differs from  columnar
storage, but you get a much better understanding by dipping your toes into the
code a bit beyond only reading docs. It's also a [vehicle for
experimentation][exp] for me to learn about databases in general, which I'm
really looking forward to.

A few questions I'd like to figure out:

1. I have only explored the tip of the iceberg here implementing 1 of the 9
   different page types. The current version would fail for most non trivial tables
   spanning multiple pages for example.
1. Figure out how indexes work. How do they maintain the sorted order?
1. Are there any tricks to handle really wide rows with 100s of columns?
1. Parsing the file for metadata is a non trivial amount of work even with all
   the information available in the headers. How much of this state is maintained
   internally and reused between queries?
1. Types are stored inside each and every record and that feels incredibly
   wasteful for properly well typed databases or newer [STRICT tables][strict].
   Figure out if there are ways to make this more efficient.
1. Transactions, Journals, Atomic Commits, MVCC, Vacuum, WAL.
1. Explore projects in the wider ecosystem like [litefs] or [libsql].


## 🔗 Other useful references

1. [SQLite Internals: Pages & B-trees][fly] by fly.io has a pretty good intro on
   varints and record structure. The blog briefly covers the various types of btree
   pages in the "Growing a tree" section, but my favorite is when Ben asks "OK, But
   Why?" [^why] and follows up with some simple answers.
1. Julia Evans's [How does SQLite work?][julia] takes a very different approach to
   the exploratory problem and the blog is nicely complimentary.
1. [Build your own SQLite][own] by Geoffrey Copin covers a whole lot more than I
   did, but our implementations differs a lot.
1. [Let's Build a Simple Database][cstack] has some useful info, but the project
   is now unmaintained. ~~The spiritual successor is [CodeCrafter's Build your own
   SQLite][cc] project, but I personally won't recommend it. The progression b/w
   subsequent steps are non linear and it's not easy to follow through.~~
1. [SQLite File Format](https://torymur.github.io/sqlite-repr) might help if you
   are starting from scratch again.
1. Definitely SQLite source. See the [DB Header description][dbheader] here for
   a really good example.

[^svg]: It took me more time to generate these diagrams than write the entire
    code. I used an LLM to generate the basic SVG outline and edited the rest by
    hand. I found popular GUI SVG editors incomprehensible and I really couldn't
    make it do the basic things I wanted.


[^ui]: I'd love to build a UI tool that can show the bidirectional link between
    the raw hexdump and parsed data structures like Godbolt shows the relationship
    b/w the high level programming language  and the generated assembly.

[^macro]: The library makes very heavy use of proc_macros, which I still don't
    understand very well. It's me, not them.

[^diff]: `$ diff -u -d --label 'Initial Version' state_init.txt --label 'Inline Update' state_inline_update.txt`

[^why]: An earlier version of this blog did had the same section but I replaced
    it with with 2 motivating examples. Sometimes knowing little details can make a
    big difference. I could have massively reduced the size of some time series
    datasets I worked with previously if I stored small integers (as low as 1 byte)
    instead of floats with decimal points (always 8 bytes). Lookup Gorilla paper for
    more info.

I've been talking to a lot of companies since I left my job at [Fybr][1], and
some of those conversations end up at compensations and perks -
mainly [Stock Options][2]. It was sold to me multiple times as something
immensely valuable and I hope to clarify some nuances with this post.

A stock option is an opportunity to buy a certain number of stocks at a reduced
price than the 'Fair Market Value (FMV)'. Buying this stock for the specified
amount is called 'Exercising' and this can be done for a period of typically up
to 3 months after the employee leaves the company, known as the 'window period'.

Imagine this scenario:

The company valued at $10M, which has 10M outstanding stocks worth a $1 each.
The employee gets option is to buy up to 10K stocks for 1$ each, roughly 0.01%
of the company. Assume a salary of $35000, roughly â‚¹23,00,000. 100% of it gets
vested over the next 4 years and the employee wants to leave. The company did
really well and current stock value is $20.

Exercising the stock is considered as capital gain in India and employees have
to pay tax on the gain <sup>[[3]][3], [[4]][4], [[5]][5]</sup> even though you
don't actually have so much money. Yep, sucks.

```
Cost of buying the stocks = 10k * $1
                          = $10,000
Taxes on capital gain     = (20 - 1) * 10K * 30%
                          = $57,000
```

Yes, the taxes that needs to be paid to buy the options might make buying them
impossible. It's roughly 40% of all the money you earned in last 4 years.

So what if you can't buy it? Here are the few scenarios.

1. You are going to lose your options in 3 months and you will effectively have
nothing. (Disclaimer: I've been in this situation and hence the post)

2. The company goes public, which realistically is not going to happen.

3. The company gets acquired - which typically just extends the vesting period
   by another few years.


The only scenario I can think of in which stock options are going to be of any
use is if the window period is significantly long - a few years at least and
a [lot of organizations are doing it][6] - For example Quora and Asana does it
for 10 years and Pinterest for 7.

Zach Holman [wrote][7] [more][8] about the topic better than I could ever do.
Julia's articles on [negotiating the offer][9] and [stock options][10] are
pretty great as well.

Most probably that 0.01% is worthless.

## Edits

1: Saju mentioned how some companies have accelerated vesting in events like
acquisitions. I don't understand the complete implications - so more information
is welcome.

I've been talking to a lot of companies since I left my job
at [Fybr](http://www.fybr-tech.com), and some of those conversations end up at
compensations and perks -
mainly [Stock Options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_stock_option). It
was sold to me multiple times as something immensely valuable and I hope to
clarify some nuances with this post.

A stock option is an opportunity to buy a certain number of stocks at a reduced
price than the 'Fair Market Value (FMV)'. Buying this stock for the specified
amount is called 'Exercising' and this can be done for a period of typically up
to 3 months after the employee leaves the company, known as the 'window period'.

Imagine this scenario:

The company valued at $10M, which has 10M outstanding stocks worth a $1 each.
The employee gets option is to buy up to 10K stocks for 1$ each, roughly 0.01%
of the company. Assume a salary of $35000, roughly â‚¹23,00,000. 100% of it gets
vested over the next 4 years and the employee wants to leave. The company did
really well and current stock value is $20.

Exercising the stock is considered as capital gain in India and employees have
to pay tax on the gain[1][2][3] even though you don't actually have so much
money. Yep, sucks.

```
Cost of buying the stocks = 10k * $1
                          = $10,000
Taxes                     = (20 - 1) * 10K * 30%
                          = $57,000
```

Yes, the taxes that needs to be paid to buy the options might make buying them
impossible. It's roughly 40% of all the money you earned in last 4 years.

So what if you can't buy it? Here are the few scenarios.

1. You are going to lose your options in 3 months and you will effectively have
nothing. (Disclaimer: I've been in this situation and hence the post)

2. The company goes public, which realistically is not going to happen.

3. The company gets acquired - which typically just extends the vesting period
   by another few years.


The only scenario I can think of in which stock options are going to be of any
use is if the window period is significantly long - a few years at least
and
[Pinterest did that](http://www.businessinsider.in/Pinterest-just-made-a-deal-with-employees-that-could-rock-the-startup-world/articleshow/46670004.cms).
They let employees hold onto options for 7 years after they leave.


Most probably that 0.01% is worthless.

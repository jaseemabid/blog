# Hacker At Heart, Starting Over

[Paathshaala](https://github.com/nitcalicut/Paathshaala) was a humble attempt to
learn some good programming. Me and [Vipin](https://twitter.com/swvist) would
sit and hack all night on random stuff, learn new things an we were just happy
about it - [but its been a while since we have done something like
that](https://github.com/jaseemabid?tab=contributions), and we are going to
challenge us, the hard way.

In a week from now, I want to write a [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) implementation in
elisp - something I wanted to learn for a long time, but never really got a
chance for. You need a good understanding of elisp to master emacs, which is the
primary objective of this task. Vipin will implement a singe player
[reversi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) game with AI and a GUI in
Erlang. I guess his love for Erlang is going to help him a lot there.

If one of us fail to do the task, he will pay the other Rs 10K (Approx $162.79),
and if both of us fail to do so, we will donate to charity. If we both win, you
can join us for a dinner at [BBQ nation](http://www.zomato.com/bangalore/barbeque-nation-indiranagar) for free,
assuming you can prove yourself to be a smarter programmer.

Now read it in [his words]().

Let the hacking begin.

title: Looking forward to 2018
---

Reflecting back on 2017, the best thing I did was to quit a mediocre job and go
to the [Recurse Center][RC]. Goodreads says I [read about 8,776 pages across 21
books][books]. Got my US visa approved and had trips to NYC, Doha and Rajastan.
Declared [NYPL][nypl] to be my favorite spot on the planet. Bike trips to
Lepakshi and B.R Hills. Had a great year with my cute little nephew. Ditched Mac
and bought a Dell XPS 13 with Linux on it. Got my [The Emperor of All
Maladies][emperor] signed. Started cooking and running. Watched my BF get
married. Watched Sarah Kay and Hans Zimmer live.

RC was definitely the most productive 3 months of my life. I learned more about
life, programming, humility, people and the world in this sweet short time than
any other time I can remember. I enjoyed almost all of this so much and it would
be such a shame to not shout it out aloud. I wrote extensively about the
experience in this blog [What did I do at Recurse Center?][what]

It was a good year indeed and I look forward to a bunch of things now.

### 1. Humility.

Being overly attached to the things I work on makes me act and behave in ways
much more harsh than I ever should. I joined Red hat late this year and I've
been my professional _worst_. I was really pissed off to find a lot of rough
edges on a project which had more resources than all the other companies I had
ever worked on combined. I agree that it is not acceptable behavior from a
senior engineer and I need to change. This is #1 priority for the new year.

The 4 [social rules][rules] of RC are supposed to be lightweight guidelines. I
hope to inculcate them in me a lot more deeply over the year.

This short conversational example from https://github.com/mroth/subtleist
explains the gist of it.

### 2. Incremental

I went through the paper [An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction][inc
paper] by Abdulaziz Ghuloum and it had a profound impact on me.

The author presents a very approachable technique for building pedagogical
compilers by starting with a tiny subset of Scheme - a language that can just
accept integers and print it. The language incrementally grows into Scheme in 24
small steps which can be understood in isolation. Every step yields a fully
working compiler for a progressively expanding subset of Scheme. Every compiler
step produces real assembly code that can be assembled and executed directly by
the hardware.

I started implementing the paper and the [code][inc code] is available on
Github. The gaps in the paper convinced me to write an [extended
tutorial/book][book] about the subject. Its only a very rough draft right now.
Completing the book in such a way that an experienced programmer new to
compilers will be able to use the book as primary reference to write a compiler
of her own would be my second goal for the year.

### 3. A well typed nanopass framework

I watched a talk titled [Writing a Nanopass Compiler][talk] by [Andy
Keep][andykeep] during a lazy afternoon at RC. The approach resonated a lot with
me but the library is in Scheme - no types and static guarantees. The Scheme
approach is to be honest very elegant and the API/macros look great. I am as
biased as it gets when it comes to types. I really wanted to do it all over
again in a well typed language.

Fear of failure is why I haven't even applied for a PhD/MS program yet even
though it is the first thought that goes through my head after I wake up most of
the days. I've stalked professors from IUB, U. Washington, Glasgow and NEU more
than I'd like to admit. The inability to do any typed functional programming in
India and the mediocrity of day jobs exacerbate the problem.

If I go back to academia today, this is what I'd work on. I hope to get neck
deep into this and see how much I can push through. As far as I could find,
there is not much research in this space and there is possibility of some
original work. My earlier attempts in Haskell didn't really go well - I missed
proper dependent types sorely. This might be the right opportunity to take the
pill and move over to the promised land of [Idris][idris]. There are a lot of
known and unknown unknowns to be solved. Its a very hard problem that will push
me harder than most other problems I've ever attempted. I'm excited.

I'm looking forward to awesomeness.

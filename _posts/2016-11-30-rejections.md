title: Rejections

Why do we not talk about our failures?

Here are a few companies that rejected me _outright without even an interview_.
This might be the motivation someone needs to keep trying and hence I believe is
worth sharing. I've truncated emails to focus on the important parts.

**Airbnb**

They wrote this huge email with a lot of nice words, but boils down to this.

> While this is never easy news to share, we’ve decided not to move forward with
> your application for this position.

**AlphaSheets**

<3 for Haskell made me apply. Clear concise reason. If you are rejecting
someone, please do it this way.

> Hey Jaseem,

**Barclays**

Again, <3 for Haskell. Probably the only rejection email which made me actually
reevaluate things and motivated me to work
harder. [Neil Mitchell](http://ndmitchell.com/) sounds like he knows what he is
doing - and my respect for him only increased.

This is also the final nail on my patriotism coffin. Reminds me one more time
that your tech career starts 10 miles behind candidates from first world
countries. Moments you really wish you were born in some random corner of Europe
than India. Made me *very* sad for being an Indian.

**CloudFlare**

I really wanted to work there after they wrote that kickass blog post on
mitigating DDOS attacks :/

**Confluent**

Well, I kind of really liked Kafka </3

**CouchBase**

No reply

**Digital Ocean**

They were looking for a lot more experience but I applied anyway. Not hard
feelings here.

**Etsy**

Same line. No feedback.

**Facebook**

These are the absolute worst. How is anyone supposed to improve and apply again
in 6 months if they don't know what went wrong?

**Github**

No reply.

**Hortonworks**

Emailed one their staff engineers, who never replied.

**Imgur**

> candidates for this particular role.

**Klarna**

This is before I wrote Erlang for a year at Fybr. I don't know what they will
say right now.

**Spotify**

This makes sense. I don't have experience with their stack.

**Standard Chartered**

I applied twice - Jan 2015 & Sep 2016. You can spend hours polishing the last
character in your email, but [Don Stewart](https://twitter.com/donsbot) probably
won't even reply. This is one of the best Haskell teams and would have been a
dream job.

I might as well share the email I sent to Don

**Uber**

No reply. Am I that stupid?

**Whatsapp**

Not surprised. I guess everyone with even a slight interest in Erlang is
applying there for a job. I cant imagine any company with a better hiring pool
than these fellas.

No reply emails.

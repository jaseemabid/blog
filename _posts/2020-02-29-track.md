title: This blog doesn't track you anymore!
---

I avoid 3rd party tracking on the web as much as I can with several ad blockers
but then forcing it on the readers of this blog felt very hypocritical.

So I've removed all Google Analytics from this blog as of now!

Fonts, CSS and some icons are loaded from 3rd party CDNs, which I hope to inline
soon. There is a link to Recurse Center below and it contains a unique token for
this blog, but it should not track you.

Enjoy your privacy and slightly faster loading times üèé

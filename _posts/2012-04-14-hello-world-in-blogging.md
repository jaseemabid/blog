# Hello world !

April 14 seems like a bit late to start work on a new year resolution - "write a tech blog in 2012!". 

This post is more or less an introduction. I don't like writing a lot and I plan to put more code and less philosophy here. I would love to share what I know and learn more from people who might stumble upon these random notes. 

I had a blog at blogspot, which apparently died because of low maintenance. I felt nothing good about wordpress or blogspot which made me sit in front of it and write something up. They might be amazing tools for somebody, but they were just not right for me! It was already there and there was nothing I could do to improve it or bend it to make work better for me. It missed the element of hacking, creativity, exploring and definitely I was not learning anything new from it. All you can do there is to write, write and write. Ah, boring! Life for me is all about learning new things and it keeps me ticking all day long. That part was just not there in blogger. 

Then I found [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/). "Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby". Design a html, css template for the blog, write blogs in simple markdown, track with git, push to github pages and, Aha! the blog published. This felt more like my way of things. I could comfortably write blogs when I wanted in my terminal with vim, track and when I feel like publishing it, its as simple as a git push. Its a lot more interactive. I can decide bits and bytes of my blog and I felt more freedom to do things. This suited me well. 

This blog is built with free software tools like [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), [jQuery](www.jquery.com) and of course [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/). I might write about JavaScript, git, Perl, programming in general, web development, jQuery, css, node, backbone, coffee script, gitweb, gsoc, vim and anything like that under the sun as I wish. This will constantly evolve. You will find features added someday, or removed. 

I believe in free software. I publish almost all code I write as free software at github. The source for this blog is pushed to its [github repository](https://github.com/jaseemabid/jaseemabid.github.com). You are free to do whatever you want with it!

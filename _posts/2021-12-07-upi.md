When UPI was launched around 2016, I used to work for a payments company and
registered the VPA `example@upi` as a joke. This turned out to be a terrible
idea and since then I'm bombarded with several inbound credits and payment
requests daily.

It took me a while to delete the handle and as of now it is gone forever.

I'm going through my transaction history for the last few years and returning
most payments one by one unless its a trivial value like ₹1. If something
doesn't look right, please reach out via email.

🙏 Sorry about this.

title: Amsterdam, A history of the world's most liberal city üìö
---

I finished reading "[Amsterdam, A history of the world's most liberal
city][goodreads]" last week and absolutely loved it. 5/5 üåü

The book is equally about a place, the people and an ideology it stands for -
liberalism. _Gedogen_ in Dutch means _"illegal but tolerated"_ and Amsterdam
seems to have developed this curious and unique attitude to so many social
issues. There aren't so many places in the world where human rights are equally
respected, where you can smoke weed legally, sit by the canals appreciating
architectural marvels, bike around almost anywhere without being run over by
cars and appreciate some Rembrandt and Van Gogh in the most majestic art
museums. The vibe is just magical and unreal. If you are curious about why
things are the way they are, it's impossible to leave the city without getting a
few history books and that's exactly what I did at the [American Book
Store][abc].

The narration is beautiful. This is definitely a history book - the author
describes how they built a city by draining the sea and building a dam to
prevent the floods and how the [Dutch East India Company][voc] made them
immensely rich with trade and colonialism. We also meet real people who start
over their lives leaving behind everything and moving to unknown lands to become
early settlers. We read about true pioneers like [Aletta Jacobs] who made
remarkable progress fighting for women's rights and suffrage and [Benno
Premsela] for gay rights. We meet celebrities like Anne Frank, Rembrandt and
Spinoza. History books can't just describe a sequence of events - this one is an
avalanche of emotions, people and stories you cannot forget.

[New] and Old Amsterdams are 2 of my favourite cities in the world and this book
made me realize again how connected they really are. Manhattan's grid layout
impressed me more than every other human achievement combined - sending humans
to Mars looks so simple in comparison. This could be because I spent the 5 years
before moving to NYC in one of the world's most congested cities were going from
one end to the other was an unspeakable nightmare. Every single day I commuted
the length of the island from 125 St to Canal St without it being a ceremony,
I've asked myself how NYC could do in [1811] what India cannot do now 200 years
later. How could some parts of the world be *centuries* ahead of others?

The book describes an incident in which the English had to find a Dutch
translator more than 100 years after the Dutch left to negotiate a trade deal
with the native Indian population because it was the only European language
known to them. Somehow Manhattan's grid is so obvious after Amsterdam's canals.
It might not seem like the most astonishing human achievement to you, but I had
such a great moment of epiphany connecting the dots.

NYC and Amsterdam both evolved to becoming the most liberal and cosmopolitan
cities in the world. Both were at some point world's wealthiest cities, largest
ports and after opening doors to flocks of immigrants during days of prosecution
and crisis, the most diverse as well.

To understand the extent of the VOC trade empire at the height of the Dutch
Golden age, we could look at this would map from 1630.

Just 100 years after the first European reached India via the sea, we have a map
that looks remarkably similar to the precise GPS versions we have now. This is
before most of the science as we know of was invented. The company that
dominated world trade also lead to one of the [first stock exchanges][amx] where
the average citizen invested some of their savings to lay the foundation of
modern capitalism.

To be honest, even though I just said all that, during the short time I spent
there I could barely find any brown people in the cafes and pubs I spent hours
reading. The Dutch were liberal, but they definitely made life in Indonesia and
other colonies hell and they waged wars all over the world including [one quite
close to where I was born and brought up][tvm]. More Jews died proportionately
in Amsterdam than almost anywhere else in Europe during WW2. There was
definitely a time when the Catholic priests and nuns were stripped and killed
and churches desecrated. A prime minister was killed on the streets and
decapitated. [Dutch Immigration laws aren't great][civil] compared to Germany. I
took me 46 days to get a 45 day [Schengen] visa.

There is a whole lot more. A brief glimpse into the Dutch monarchy and we learn
how closely tied every European monarchy really is. The dutch [took over][w3]
the English crown once without even a war. For a while 30% of all the books
published in world were from Amsterdam. Roots of religious tolerance and how
Protestantism replaced Roman Catholicism. There is a lot said about how NYC
influenced the rest of America and what it stands for. Obviously a lot about the
canals and the tulip mania. This book made me think hard and I loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è

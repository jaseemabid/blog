üì£ **I‚Äôm taking a sabbatical from April 7th to May 31st**

This is a difficult time to operate a business and to help my company reduce costs, I‚Äôm taking a sabbatical for 8 weeks. Read more [here](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/monzo-ceo-wont-take-a-salary).

This helps everyone at work ü§û keep our jobs in the long term by saving some cost in the middle of the pandemic. I was a bit burned out and needed a break to go back to my side projects, read the books I‚Äôve always wanted to and spend some time away from the usual routine. I‚Äôm looking at this as a win-win situation! I‚Äôm even learning to touch type properly!

This also means my friends can call me anytime and I‚Äôd be up for chat üôå

Staying focused in a time like this is going to be really hard. I maintained [a public journal of what I did everyday](/2017/08/10/rc.html) during [Recurse Center](recurse.com) and it really helped me look back often and feel that I wasn‚Äôt completely wasting my time. I‚Äôm going to try that again for the next few weeks. I‚Äôd be happy (and surprised) if I manage to stay sane through this lockdown.

## April 7

And it begins.

## April 15

I'm starting to feel productive working on [Inc] regularly. I can pick up things in the morning without losing much context from the previous day. Having a larger fraction of the code in my head is definitely helping.

The mounts for my monitors arrived and my home office setup now feels cozy! 2 large monitors is great and I‚Äôll find it hard to go back to tiny laptop screens.

I usually stick with a very small set of tools to get work done but I revisited that list lately and added a few more. I needed better tools to stay organised and focused during the pandemic and so far this is helping.  I might migrate from the proprietary tools later as I find FOSS alternatives, but for now these are working well.

1. I switched from Emacs to [Zettlr](zettlr.com) for long form writing and markdown.  
I‚Äôve used Emacs as my primary editor for almost 10 years now and I love it, but it‚Äôs starting to show it‚Äôs age quite often. I could spend a couple of days tweaking Emacs to do 80% of Zettlr, but often its just easier to pick a different tool. Its pretty, works well with a folder of text files and is robust enough.

2. Bookmarks with [raindrop.io](raindrop.io)  
Being able to add a note on why I‚Äôm bookmarking something is the killer feature‚Ñ¢ I needed. I had hundreds of bookmarks I no longer needed in a clumsy folder called ‚Äúrefile‚Äù which I never looked at. I spent an hour or so deleting most of it and reorganising the relevant ones into a few folders and this feels like a much better way of organizing knowledge for the long term.

3. [Todoist](todoist.com) is my primary task manager.  
I really enjoyed the daily standups with my team and during the last few weeks, they were laser focused based on our JIra board. I‚Äôm trying to replicate that for personal work.

4. I switched my terminal to [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty) from [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) for better Unicode/Emoji support.

Last 2 days have been exhausting but productive. Some of the long term annoyances with the runtime got cleaned up - A prelude gets compiled with every program, a nice wrapper Object type around the naked pointers and rudimentary support for working with stdio. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I should use IO primitives from libc or if I could ‚Äúcheat‚Äù with rust instead. Still not very clear here on how to proceed.

TIL Panicking in a Rust function called from C is mostly in the undefined behaviour territory. I‚Äôm hoping to replace the final bits of C in Inc with Rust soon, but I‚Äôm not very hopeful about this. Getting rid of an entire programming language would be glorious!

title: Copy URLs in Safari with a keyboard shortcut
---

I really loved the [Arc Browser](https://arc.net), but after last week's [major
security incident][cve], I can't trust them anymore to run my primary browser.
They did a hundred little things to make it the most polished web browser I have
ever used and I will definitely miss it.

Anyway, I went back to Safari and its many paper cuts. I got used to most of the
quirks, but I would end up pressing âŒ˜ â‡§ C a dozen times daily to copy the URL,
only to be presented with a very silly element selection feature in dev tools,
which I never need.

I figured it would be easier to fix the browser than retrain my muscle memory,
and thankfully, there are enough knobs built into macOS to make this not so
painful.

## Step 1: Write some Apple Script.

I found the rough template on [reddit], which I didn't have to tweak much except
disabling the conflicting keybinding.

1. Create a new service in Automation.app
2. Select Safari.app, with "workflow receives" set to "no input".
3. Use the following AppleScript[^1] code, and save it with a name like "Copy
Safari URL".

```applescript
on run {input, parameters}
    tell application "Safari"
        set theURL to URL of front document
        set the clipboard to theURL
    end tell
end run
```

## Step 2: Enable the keybinding in keyboard settings.

Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services > General

## Step 3: Disable the conflicting command

Found the basic idea of disabling inbuilt shortcuts from this
[StackOverflow][so] post. You find the exact name of the command you want to
disable ('Start Element Selection'), and rebind it to something completely
different.


Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > App Shortcuts > Safari

[^1]: AppleScript must be the most bizarre and quirky programming language
    ever invented. I can write code in over a dozen programming languages but
    AppleScript is the most incomprehensible of them all.

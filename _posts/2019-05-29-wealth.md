title: Wealth of Nations
---

I grew up and spent the first 25 years of my life in India. I lived a short
while in NYC to attend the [recurse center][rc] and now I live in the UK. I saw
a bit more of the tiny blue marble in the meanwhile.

Hans Rosling says in [Factfulness] that you cannot divide the world into board
"First" and "Third" world categories anymore and the divide is closing; but as
someone who got to see a fair bit of both sides of the spectrum, it is my
opinion that the divide is unspeakably huge and is much worse than he paints it
to be. I earn almost 2x per day today than my first monthly salary out of
college doing pretty much the same job. Life can change a lot when you get paid
70x.

India is unspeakably poor. [Purchasing power][ppp] is around 120th among the 180
countries tracked by the world bank. [Literacy rate][literacy] is around the
same bracket. What the average British could take for granted a 100 years ago
won't happen in India for another century. Looking at the current state of the
nation, it is only getting much worse.

I've been thinking *a lot* about what makes some countries wealthy and some
poor. I enjoy learning macro economics and I hope to spend time in the next few
months learning more; hopefully updating this post with details.

I normally enjoy reading <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/economics?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#economics</a> and I&#39;d love to read more about how nations build their economies and the factors that make them wealthy or poor.

Here are some of the book suggestions from the twitter thread.

_1. The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith_

I'm honestly not sure if much of this is relevant anymore since he spends maybe
30% of the book talking about wheat prices in London. Its over 1200 pages long
and a bit too dry to keep reading.

- [Investopedia summary][wealth 1]

_2. Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty_

I've a paperback already, so this might be the first in the list.

<i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> [Why nations fail \| James Robinson \| TEDxAcademy][fail talk]

_3 Debt: The First 5,000 Years by David Graeber_

<i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> [DEBT: The First 5,000 Years \| David Graeber \| Talks at Google][debt talk]

_4. Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty_

_5. Development as Freedom by Amartya Sen_

_6. The Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World by Ruchir Sharma_

_7. The wealth of Networks by Yochai Benkler_ [(pdf)][networks]

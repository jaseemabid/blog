title: The Î£ problem
---

It's been 6 weeks at [RC][1]. First half of the 12 week program is over and it's
time for some reflection and introspection.

Most of the days I'm happy with the progress I make, but somehow the six weeks
don't add up. I learned a lot out of [Olifant][2] and I just summarized a lot of
that in a long [blog][3] post. I must have rewritten some parts of it over half
a dozen times. Each rewrite is a proof that I learned something new which I
didn't know maybe 48 hours ago.

I often wonder if it really should have taken 6 weeks. Something feels wrong about

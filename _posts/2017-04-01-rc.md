title: What I want to do at Recurse Center
---

I'll be joining [Recurse Center][rc] for their Summer 1 batch from May 22nd to
Aug 10th. RC is a self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for
programmers in New York City.

I am going to use my tiny lisp interpreter called [lisper][lisper] as an
umbrella project to explore a few fundamental ideas in computer science; mainly:

1. Code generation
1. Garbage Collection
1. Scheduling

Following Andrew Ng's [advice][advice], I picked projects that I'm definitely
underqualified for. I'll explain why this matters to me.

## 1. Code Generation

Writing an interpreter is easy. You can cheat by making the host language do
most of the heavy lifting. You write a parser to parse the string into
an [AST][ast] and then evaluate it by walking down and replacing expressions
with values. All the primitives operations like numeric computation and string
manipulation; classic data structures like arrays and maps etc can be mapped
directly to the host language. You typically don't have to worry about function
calling conventions or garbage collection because it works automatically. This
feels wrong when your intention is to learn how things work.

I think it is going to be interesting dealing with nothing but a few primitive
operations and a couple of registers. I've no idea how I'll generate code for a
curried function. I know how [tail call optimizations][tco] work, but only at a
10,000ft view. I have a rough idea of how the C [calling conventions][cc] work,
but it's not sufficient. I have to implement it before I master it.

There are a whole lot of challenges here and I will have to learn a lot before I
can start. What platform will I target? Should I go very low-level like native
x86/LLVM or a pick a high-level abstraction like C\-\-, BEAM or JVM? Or should I
write a toy VM to start with? Maybe a [Symbolics][symbolics] or Atari emulator
for fun? Who knows?

## 2. Garbage Collection

I'm a big fan of [statically typed pure functional programming][haskell] and one
of the important factors that contribute to the insane performance is the
kickass GC under the hood. It is critical for any high-level language which
generates a lot of intermediate objects; even more, if the values are immutable
like Erlang or Clojure.

I poked into the [recent][sub-sec] GC developments in Go 1.8 and didn't
understand it well enough. I worked with the per-process GC of Erlang for a
while and it looked really great. There are myriad ways to tune the JVM GC. All
of this sounds so exciting and I'm really looking forward to some crazy
experiments.

**Some further reading**,

## 3. Scheduler

I fell in love with Erlang's preemptive scheduler and its approach to fault
tolerance immediately after I started working with it. It is significantly
easier to write systems that will keep working even when some parts of it behave
badly. For example, it would be pretty terrible if Emacs crashed every time
Skype went down; but somehow we consider this to be acceptable while developing
software. Shitty python exceptions affect every user on your web application,
not just the user that caused it.

Erlang's processes act independently of one another. One process cannot block or
starve another one, just like operating systems. This is called a preemptive
scheduler. The runtime or OS can stop and start processes wherever it wants to -
leading to fair utilization of resources b/w competing concurrent units.

Contrast this with node.js, where all the callbacks and handlers execute in the
same context, affecting each other in myriad ways and any one of them can block
and starve everyone else. This is called co-operative scheduling.

I want to implement both strategies for lisper.

There is still a lot more to do, but I don't think I'll have any time left. A
type checker would be great to have. Support for distributed systems would be
awesome.

RC is a lot about discovering new things from fellow recursers. I hope to get
pulled into interesting projects by other people. Fixing unknown unknowns :)

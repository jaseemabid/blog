# Hi! I'm Jaseem Abid

I'm a computer programmer at Bangalore, India.

## Who am I?

I'm an extrovert who loves great conversations. An atheist, pluviophile and
sapiosexual interested in a wide variety of subjects like religion, politics,
economics, oncology, history, beer, and philosophy.

[I buy random people coffee and listen to them](http://haveyoumetjaseem.in).

I love [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8190839-jaseem), riding my
bike or listening to [music](http://www.last.fm/user/jaseemabid).

I will make you laugh and maybe teach you something you never knew.

## What do I work on?

The idea of correct computer programs that doesn't fail fascinate me and I'm
exploring the various possibilities of doing so.

I am interested in distributed systems, programming languages and Haskell.
